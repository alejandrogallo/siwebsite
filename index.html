						<p>PulseStreamer significantly upgraded our spectroscopic capabilities. We had it performing arbitrary pulse sequences from the morning and on the afternoon of that day we were performing single centre pulsed ODMR with it (for the first time ever at Warwick), and now these measurements are routine! We are now using it PulseStreamer to probe delays in our hardware we weren’t even aware we had!</p>

						<p>We have been very impressed with TimeTagger's specifications, unrivalled flexibility of use and excellent value for money.  Swabian Instruments deserve considerable recognition not only for this innovative product, but for their user-oriented approach, and for their desire to develop instrumentation that will help to accelerate this field of research.</p>  </p>

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p style="font-size:16px;">
        We are a small group of enthusiastic physicists, computer scientists,
        and electrical engineers based in Stuttgart, Germany, with strong ties
        to the University of Stuttgart.
        <br><br>

        Our corporate goal is to provide high-quality electronics and service
        for our colleagues in the education, research, and development fields
        at highly competitive prices.
        <br><br>

        Our focus is on detection and generation of reliable, fast arbitrary
        digital signals and our long term interest is to create a range of
        interoperable instruments with superior characteristics and supporting
        complex control-loop feedback experiments.
        <br><br>

        Currently two of our products, TimeTagger 
        and PulseStreamer, are commercially available, and two additional products, PulseEmitter and DigiLoop, are becoming
        available in 2016.
        <br><br>

        <b>TimeTagger</b> is an inexpensive, programmable, general-purpose,
        continuous-operation, high-speed, multi-channel digital signal
        acquisition device.  The device is implemented on the basis of a
        Time-Tag architecture and views measurement events, such as
        laser-pulses and photon-emissions, as a continuous data-stream,
        consisting of an infinite number of events.
        <br><br>

        <b>PulseStreamer</b> is a streaming pulse generator capable of
        generating infinite streams of pulses, including white noise.  It is
        the logical complement to TimeTagger and is currently available to the
        public as a Beta product.  As a Beta product, PulseStreamer is priced
        of half of the device's planned retail price and comes with an extended
        Beta warranty, which guarantees that the Beta device will be updated to
        - or replaced with - a full release version once PulseStreamer goes
        into general release.
        <br><br>


        <b>PulseEmitter</b> is a programmable pulsating laser that can be be
        programmed using a USB connection and can be controlled by a pulse
        generator such as PulseStreamer 8/2.  The device is capable of
        replacing acousto-optic modulators (AOM) and has terrific
        characteristics (it has a rise time that is quite a bit faster than an
        AOM, essentially infinite on/off ratio, and negligible delay, negating
        the need for programmed delays.) PulseEmitter is available as an Alpha
        product on very favorable terms.  Contact us for details.
        <br><br>

        <b>DigiLoop</b> is a digital PID controller. This
        product is currently in the design phase and is not yet available to
        the public.
