            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                We are a small group of enthusiastic physicists, computer scientists, and 
                electrical engineers based in Stuttgart, Germany, with strong ties to the 
                University of Stuttgart.<br><br>
                Our corporate goal is to provide high-quality electronics and service 
                for our colleagues in the education, research, and development fields at highly competitive prices. <br><br>
                Our focus is on detection and generation of reliable, fast arbitrary digital signals and our long term interest is to 
                create a range of interoperable instruments with superior characteristics supporting complex control-loop feedback experiments.<br><br>
                Currently two of our products are commercially available, TimeTagger 20 and PulseStreamer 8/2, and 
                two additional products are becoming available in 2016, PulseEmitter and ProgrammablePID <br><br>
                <b>TimeTagger 20</b> is an inexpensive, programmable, general-purpose, continuous-operation,
                high-speed, multi-channel digital signal acquisition device.  The device is implemented on the basis of a 
                Time-Tag architecture and views measurement events, such as laser-pulses and photon-emissions, as 
                a continuous data-stream, consisting of an infinite number of events.
               
                <br><br>
                <b>PulseStreamer 8/2</b> is a streaming pulse generator capable of generating infinite streams of pulses, including
                white noise.  It is the logical complement to TimeTagger and is currently available to the public as a Beta product.  As a Beta product, 
                PulseStreamer is priced of half of the device's planned retail price and comes with an Beta warranty, which guarantees that the Beta device
                will be updated to, or replaced with, a full release version, once PulseStreamer goes into general release.<br><br>
              
                <b>PulseEmitter</b> is a programmable pulsating laser that can be be programmed using a USB connection 
                and can controlled by a pulse 
                generator such as PulseStreamer 8/2.  The device has terrific characteristics (it has a rise time that is 
                quite a bit faster than an AOM, essentially infinite on/off ratio, and negligible delay.)
                PulseEmitter is available as an Alpha product.  Contact us for details.<br><br>
                <b>ProgrammablePID</b> is a software programmable proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller.)  
                This product is currently in the design phase and not yet available to the public.
