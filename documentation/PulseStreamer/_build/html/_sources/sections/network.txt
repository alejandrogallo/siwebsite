******************
Network Connection
******************

In order to communicate with the Pulse Streamer, you need to know its IP.
By default the Pulse Streamer will attempt to acquire an IP address via
DHCP. If no IP address is received after 20 seconds, it will fallback to a static
IP address 192.168.1.100.

assign a static IP with the MAC address and DHCP
------------------------------------------------

You can configure your DHCP server or router to assign a static
DHCP IP to the Pulse Streamer's MAC address. In this way you
know the IP that the Pulse Streamer will receive by DHCP.
You find the MAC address of your Pulse Streamer
on the bottom of the device.

To verify your network configuration, open a terminal and enter

::

    [user@host~] arp
    
    Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
    192.168.1.108            ether   00:26:32:f0:09:30   C                     wlp1s0
    router                   ether   18:83:bf:c1:1f:67   C                     wlp1s0

In this example the first line is the Pulse Streamer and the second
line is the router.


use 192.168.1.100 static fallback IP
------------------------------------

Either connect your Pulse Streamer directly to your computer with
an ethernet cable or setup a static 192.168.1.xxx network and connect the Pulse Streamer
to this network. Assign a static IP to your computer that is not 192.168.1.100, e.g. 192.168.1.88.

Note that with this configuration, the startup time
is delayed by about 20 seconds since the Pulse Streamer searches for
a DHCP IP at every startup. This can be improved by setting the default
IP configuration to static.

modify the network settings
---------------------------

Requirements:

 * network access to your Pulse Streamer (e.g. 192.168.1.100 static fallback)
 * ssh / putty


verify network access to your Pulse Streamer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

open a console and enter

::

    ping <pulse_streamer_ip>

where <pulse_streamer_ip> is the IP of your Pulse Streamer. You should see something like

::

    [user@host~] ping 192.168.1.108

    PING 192.168.1.108 (192.168.1.108) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.108: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=6.74 ms


Login to your Pulse Streamer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Windows:

Open `putty <http://www.putty.org/>`_, enter the IP of your Pulse Streamer and press 'Open'. If you connect
for the first time, a security alert about an unknown host key should pop up. Click 'Yes' to store
the host key for the future. Enter the username 'root' and password 'root'.

Linux:

Open a terminal and enter

::

    ssh root@<pulse_streamer_ip>

where <pulse_streamer_ip> is the IP of your Pulse Streamer. Enter the password 'root'.

::

    [user@host~] ssh root@192.168.1.100
    root@192.168.1.108's password: root

Edit the IP configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Open the IP configuration file in the `vi <http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/>`_ editor.

::

    vi /opt/pulsestreamer/etc/network/interfaces

Switch to 'insert mode'.

::

    i

Change the file according to your needs. For DHCP, these lines should be
uncommented

::

    # Dynamic (DHCP) IP address
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet dhcp
        udhcpc_opts -t7 -T3

For a static IP configuration, these lines should be uncommented.
Modify these lines to your needs.

::

    # static IP address
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.1.101
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 192.168.1.1

When you are done with your edits, press

::

    <ESC>
    
to exit 'insert mode'. To save your changes, type

::

    ZZ
    
To discard your changes, type

::

    :q!

Reboot your Pulse Streamer.
