Software Overview
*****************


The heart of the *TimeTagger 20* software is a multi-threaded driver
that receives the time tag stream and feeds it to all running
measurements. Measurements are small threads that analyze the time tag stream
each in their own way. E.g., a count rate measurement will extract all time
tags of a specific channel and calculate the average number of tags received per
second, a cross-correlation measurement will compute the cross-correlation between two
channels, typically by sorting the time tags in histograms, etc.. This is a
powerful architecture that allows you to perform any thinkable digital time domain
measurement in real time. You have several choices to use this architecture.


Web application and JSON-RPC interface
======================================
.. Note:: This feature is currently under development. Please contact us if you would like to use the timetagger in this way.

The easiest way of using the *TimeTagger 20* is via a web application
that allows you to interact with the hardware from a web browser on your computer
or a tablet. You can create measurements
and get life plots, save and load the acquired data from within a web browser.
In addition, you can also access and reomte control the web application
via a JSON-RPC interface.



Precompiled libraries and high level language bindings
======================================================
We have implemented a set of typical measurements including count rates, auto
correlation, cross correlation, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), etc..
For most users, these measurements
will cover all needs. These measurements are included in
the C++ API and provided as precompiled library files. To make using the
TimeTagger even easier, we have equipped these libraries with
bindings to higher level languages, specifically Python so that you can directly
use the TimeTagger from this language.
With these APIs you can easily start a complex
measurement from a higher level language with only two lines of code. 
To use one of these APIs, you have to write code in the high
level language of your choice. Refer to chapter :ref:`quickstart` and :ref:`api`
if you plan to use the TimeTagger in this way.

.. Note:: Bindings for other languages such as Java, Matlab and Labview are available upon request.

C++ API
=======
The underlying software architecture is provided by a C++ API that implements
two classes: one class that represent the TimeTagger and one class that
represents a base measurement. Ontop of that, the C++ API also provides
all predefined measurements that are made available by the web
application and high level language bindings. To use this API, you have to
write and compile a C++ program. If you want to implement a custom
measurement you need to follow this approach. Refer to
chapter :ref:`API` if you plan to use the TimeTagger in this way.
