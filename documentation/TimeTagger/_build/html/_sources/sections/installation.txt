Windows users
=============

Requirements
------------

Operating System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The installer provided supports Windows 7 and Windows 10 (32 and 64 bit).

Python
^^^^^^

If you want to run the Python **quickstart guide**, you need the following additional third-party software packages (available for free).

* **Python 2.7.x** or **Python 3.5.x** installed along with **ipython**
* the following Python modules: **numpy, matplotlib (pylab), time, cPickle**

On Windows it is easiest to install a **Python distribution** that contains all required
packages by default. The **anaconda** or **canopy** Python distributions will cover this.
If you don't have Python installed, please download and install now either
of these Python distributions. Note that **anaconda** is available as **Python 3.5.x**.

.. note:: If you are using a fresh install of the **canopy** distribution, please make sure to run the graphical interface once from the start menu to have your Python paths set up correctly.


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: If you intend to use the *TimeTagger 20* with the Python programming language, please make sure that you install Python first as described above. This ensures that the installer detects your Python installation automatically.

#. Download and run the most recent *TimeTagger 20* windows installer.

Connect the *TimeTagger 20* to your computer with the USB cable. 

.. caution:: Wait until windows has recognized the device and finished installing the driver.
 
You should now be ready to use your *TimeTagger 20*.


Linux users
===========

The TimeTagger can be used under Linux with C++ or Python. There is no installer package yet, so please contact us if you want to use the TimeTagger under Linux.
