Installation instructions

Windows users
=============

Requirements
------------

Operating System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All 32 and 64 bit windows versions since windows XP are supported.

Python
^^^^^^

If you want to run the **quickstart guide**,
or the **web application** (currently under development),
you need the following additional third-party software packages (available for free).

* **python 2.7.x** or **python 3.4.x** installed along with **ipython**
* the following python modules: **numpy, matplotlib (pylab), time, cPickle**

On windows it is easiest to install a **python distribution** that contains all required
packages by default. The **anaconda** or **canopy** python distributions will cover this.
If you don't have python installed, please download and install now either
of these python distributions. Note that **anaconda** is available as **python 3.4.x**.

.. note:: If you are using a fresh install of the **canopy** distribution, please make sure to run the graphical interface once from the start menu to have your python paths set up corectly.


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: If you intend to use the *TimeTagger 20* with the Python programming language, please make sure that you install python first as described above. This ensures that the installer detects your Python installation automatically.

#. Download and run the most recent *TimeTagger 20* windows installer.

Connect the *TimeTagger 20* to your computer with the USB cable. 

.. caution:: Wait until windows has recognized the device and finished installing the driver.
 
You should now be ready to use your *TimeTagger 20*.
