Data connection
===============

A USB connection is used for data and power supply. Please ensure that the USB port is capable of providing the full
specified current (500 mA). A USB 2.0 data connection is required for reasonable performance. Operating the device via
a USB hub is strongly discouraged.





Input channels
==============

The TimeTagger has 8 SMA connectorized input channels numbered 0 to 7 throughout this document. The electrical
characteristics are tabulated below. Both rising and falling edges are detected on the input channels.
On the software level, rising edges correspond to channel numbers 0 to 7 and falling edges correspond to
respective channel numbers 8 to 15. Thereby, you can treat rising and falling edges in a fully equivalent fashion.

Laser synchronization filter
============================


In a typical fluorescence lifetime application, a target is stimulated with laser pulses with
a fast repetition rate, typically in the 10 to 100 MHz range. Electrical synchronization pulses
are generated that are simultaneous with the excitation laser pulses and are sent to
the TimeTagger along with the single photon signals detected from the target. Because the
data rate of the synchronization pulses is so high, streaming and processing all generated
time tags by the computer is not feasible - and not necessary, since only those synchronization
pulses are of interest that are followed by a photon event. It is therefore desirable
to discard all synchronization time tags in the data stream except those that are followed by a photon.
Since the synchronization pulses are periodic with a very well defined period, it is equivalent
to keep only those synchronization time tags that follow a photon.

This feature is implemented by the onboard event filter that is currently hardcoded between
channel 0 and channel 7. It is assumed that photon clicks are entering channel 0 and laser sync clicks
are entering channel 7. When the filter is active, time tags on channel 7 are only passed
if a time tag has been registered on channel 0 before. Subsequent tags are discarded until the next
tag on channel 0 is detected.



General purpose IO (available upon request)
===========================================


The device is ready to be equipped with up to four SMA connectorized general purpose IO ports. These can be used
to implement custom features such as special fast input or output triggers, enable / disable gates,
software controllable input and output lines, etc.. Please contact us for custom designs.
