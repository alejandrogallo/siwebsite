#. Make sure the TimeTagger software is installed and the TimeTagger connected to your computer (see the Windows quickstart card).
#. Open a command shell and ``cd`` to the examples folder on the USB stick
#. Start an **ipython** shell
#. Run the **test.py** script by entering ``run test``, this will create an instance **time_tagger** that represents the device.
#. Check the channel jitter calibration by ...
#. Start the builtin test signal by … this will enable an about 3 MHz square wave applied internally to all input channels
#. Create a simple countrate on the first two channel … by entering …
#. Upon running of ``count_rate.getData()`` will return the average countrate since its instantiation
#. Create a crosscorrelation …
#. Connect an external signal (e.g. a 1 MHz square wave, 1V). 
   	.. danger:: Make sure that the frequency of the external signal does not exceed 
   		the maximum time tag rate of ~10 MHz. Deactivate the builtin test signal.
#. Adjust the triggerlevel see how the rate changes.
